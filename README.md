# NBA Players' Heights

The task is to create an application that takes a single integer input. The application will download the raw data from [this API](https://mach-eight.uc.r.appspot.com) and print a list of all pairs of players whose height in inches adds up to the integer input to the application. If no matches are found, the application will print "No matches found". The algorithm to find the pairs has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n). All edge cases are handled appropriately. Unit tests are implemented using Jest. This application is built with JavaScript, React, Redux, and Bootstrap.
